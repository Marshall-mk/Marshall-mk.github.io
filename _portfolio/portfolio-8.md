title: "[Implementation of a Deep Learning-enabled Brain Tumor Detection and Segmentation Device](https://github.com/Marshall-mk/Brain-tumor-classification-using-MR-images)"
excerpt: "Built and deployed an ensemble of deep learning (CNNs & Res-Unet) models to detect, classify and segment brain tumors in
magnetic resonance brain scans on a raspberryPi module coupled with a webapp made with DASH. The model achieved a
96% classification accuracy and segmentation 98.58% accuracy."
