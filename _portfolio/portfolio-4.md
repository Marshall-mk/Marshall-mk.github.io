title: "[Dental Assistant Robot for Surgical Procedures](https://github.com/Marshall-mk/CASMR)"
excerpt: "This project develops a dental assistant robot using the Staubli TX60 to automate anesthesia delivery and suction during dental procedures, aiming to enhance efficiency and reduce 
dentist fatigue. Programmed with VAL 3 and tested on a skeleton head model, the robot achieves these tasks with a user interface, syringe, suction tool, and features like progress indicators, 
achieving a repeatability of Â±0.02 mm. While successful in a controlled setting, the industrial robot lacks the precision and adaptability needed for real patients, highlighting its potential 
as a foundation for future dental automation advancements.[Paper](/files/Robotics.pdf)"
