title: "[Lung CT Volume Registration: Medical Image Registration and Applications](https://github.com/Marshall-mk/MIRA)"
excerpt: "In this project, we carried out lung computed tomography (CT) image registration on a provided dataset utilizing both intensity-based and deep learning-based techniques. The training dataset comprised 4 pairs of volumetric
scans, each accompanied by corresponding annotations (landmark points). The effectiveness of the registration algorithms was initially assessed using the Target Registration Error (TRE), defined as the 3D Euclidean distance
between the transformed landmarks. This project demonstrated the impact of parameter optimization and segmentation masks in improving the accuracy of lung CT scan registration. By fine-tuning registration
parameters and incorporating lung segmentation methods, a notable reduction in the mean TRE was achieved. The final optimized model achieved a mean TRE of 1.44 mm with a mean STD TRE of 1.77 mm and mean execution time of 250 seconds across all cases. [Paper](/files/MIRA_FINAL_REPORT_MKH_FF.pdf)"
