title: "[Lung CT Volume Registration: Medical Image Registration and Applications](https://github.com/Marshall-mk/MIRA)"
excerpt: "This project focuses on lung CT image registration using intensity-based and deep learning techniques on a dataset of 4 volumetric scan pairs with landmark annotations. By optimizing parameters and integrating lung segmentation masks, the registration accuracy improved, reducing the mean Target Registration Error (TRE) to 1.44 mm, with a standard deviation of 1.77 mm and an execution time of 250 seconds per case.
