title: "[Brain tissue segmentation using Multi-atlas and Deep learning approaches](https://github.com/Marshall-mk/MISA)"
excerpt: "This project develops and evaluates brain tissue segmentation methods for MRI scans, targeting cerebrospinal fluid, grey matter, and white matter using the IBSR 18 dataset. It compares classical intensity-based methods (Dice scores 0.5586–0.8730), multi-atlas techniques (0.8177–0.8541), and deep learning models, with the 2.5D U-Net achieving the highest scores (0.8892–0.9261) and an ensemble reaching 0.9215. The study highlights the 2.5D U-Net’s superior performance, particularly for challenging CSF segmentation, emphasizing the value of deep learning and ensemble strategies in medical imaging.
