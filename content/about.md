# About Me

I am a Research Student in Medical Imaging and Applications at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology under the supervision of Prof. Xiaomeng Li, anticipating completion of my Master's degree in June 2025.

My research interests include medical image synthesis and interpretation using advanced deep learning techniques. I also explore resource-efficient deep learning methods and machine learning operations. My journey encompasses rigorous internships as well as personal research where I honed my skills in generative AI, MLOps, and data pipelines, vital for modern medical diagnostics.

The drive to integrate AI into healthcare propels my research, focusing on transformative machine learning applications for medical imaging. This work is supported by a strong foundation in Biomedical Engineering from the University of Ilorin and reinforced by multiple honors for academic excellence.
